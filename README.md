Individual Reflection

The time spent in this module has been both overwhelming and refreshing. There are times I ask myself why go through all these long and late hours trying to understand the algorithm of machine learning and the neural networks of deep learning?  However, looking back from my previous modules, I realized that I wrote codes better and faster using online teaching videos such as YouTube. Therefore, I decided to make use of the same approach to learn how to write codes in both machine and deep learning. Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (1988) gives a structure to learning from experiences. It offers a framework for examining experiences, and given its cyclic nature lends itself particularly well to repeated experiences, allowing one to learn and plan from things that either went well or did not go well. 


Working in my team project revealed different thinking habits and solution styles, this exposure made me to understand problem solving in a different perspective. The social theory of learning suggests that individuals actively construct their knowledge based on their experiences, interactions with others, and the cultural context in which they live. After completing my team project and graded a distinction, I felt a sense of believe that I can handle machine-learning problem. According to Pekrun's control-value theoretical model (2006), perceived control over outcomes and achievement activities increases positive emotions and decreases most negative emotions. 


From critical thinking and problem-solving techniques, to research and effective communication and presentation skills, this module has equipped me to handle machine and deep learning problems in real-world contexts. Cheng Xie, et al. examined the relationships among motivational beliefs, negative emotions, and academic achievement in college online students. Motivation had a negative correlation with students’ negative emotions.



In this reflective essay, I would explore how the skills I have developed and the knowledge I have acquired have had an effect on both my personal and professional growth. The skills I acquired during this module, after several hours of learning and practice provided a solid foundation in my understanding and solving of machine and deep learning problems. 


Our team project focused on using data driven analysis on Airbnb dataset to predict price, demand trends and customer segmentation. It involved importing the required libraries, uploading the Airbnb dataset into a data frame and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
We discovered from our EDA, that the neighborhood group had fewer available listings. From the regression analysis, we found valuable factors influencing the pricing of listings in our Airbnb dataset. We discovered that room type and location are the major factors that affect price, whereas host activity and booking criteria had a smaller effect. We identified from our correlation model that location influence pricing while the number of reviews, Latitude, minimum nights, and calculated host listings had little impact on host pricing.


Our data analysis with K-Means Clustering revealed valuable insights for Airbnb hosts and stakeholders on how they can approach marketing for different client segments. It showed three distinct groups: the budget-friendly (low-price, moderate reviews), the standard (moderate price and reviews), and the luxury (high-price, high-reviews). Hosts in the standard segment should focus on maintaining competitive pricing and high guest satisfaction to stand out, while budget-friendly hosts can prioritize increasing occupancy and generating positive reviews. Luxury hosts should highlight unique experiences and high-end amenities to justify premium pricing. 


From our data analysis, we discovered that Airbnb has substantial growth opportunities in New York City, a strong demand around key landmarks, presenting an opportunity to maximize profits by focusing on accommodations in these prime locations. Airbnb can leverage these insights to optimize marketing strategies, targeting budget travelers with special offers and luxury segments through tailored, exclusive channels.

I used the leNet architecture which is made up of input layers, convolutional layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers to designed a convolutional neural network, that extracted features from the images in CIFAR -10 dataset. I trained the model and evaluated the model’s ability to produce the desired or intended result during my individual project.   My model showed a higher percentage in accuracy of 78% in identifying the class of images using convolutional neural network (CNN) than when CNNs where not used.


Thinking carefully about the time I spent in this module; I am now confident in my ability to face and tackle machine and deep learning questions and problems more effectively. The experience and skills I gained has propelled me to be interested in future learnings.
